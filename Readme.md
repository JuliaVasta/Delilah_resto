## Delilah

# Development server

1. Install database (I include a SQL bump `delilah.sql`)
2. Create a file .env based on .env-sample. It includes the database URL and both passwords for regular and administrator user.

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

3. You can test the endpoints from the Postman collection (I include a json file `delilah_resto.postman_collection.json`)
